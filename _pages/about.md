About me
====
I am a psychiatrist and psychotherapist at [Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin](https://psychiatrie-psychotherapie.charite.de/en/research/psychotic_disorders/empathy_and_interpersonal_processes/). Since 2022, I have been participating in the Digital Clinician Scientist Program of the Berlin Institute of Health. I do both clinical work with people suffering from severe mental illness as well as research at the intersection of psychiatry, linguistics, and natural language processing. Since 2024, I have been leading the [Research Group on Language and Natural Language Processing in Psychiatry](https://psychiatrie-psychotherapie.charite.de/en/research/research_group_language_and_natural_language_processing_in_psychiatry/). In my free time, I curate [Art Brut exhibitions](https://www.art-cru.de/) and row on the lakes around Berlin.
